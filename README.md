# GCxGC-MS alignment algorithm
This algorithm is used to align GCxGC-MS chromatograms according to the method of 
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002196731730804X">Zushi et al., 2017</a>. The algorithm
is programmed in Matlab, and it represents an adaptation of a previous method to multivariate detectors. For univariate detector data, please refer to the method of:
